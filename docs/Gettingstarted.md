# Getting started

# Setup

There are currently two ways to install Comet in your game, either by grabbing the Roblox model in the library, or syncing Comet into your game with Rojo.

## With Roblox Studio

- Grab the [Roblox model](https://www.roblox.com/library/7557538677/Comet) via the tool box.
- Place it in ReplicatedStorage.

## With Rojo

- Install the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/angrybino/Comet/releases).
- Extract the binary source.
- Rename the `src` folder to `Comet`, and move the `src` folder to your game's repository.
- Have Rojo point `Comet` to ReplicatedStorage.
