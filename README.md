# Comet

Comet is a advanced framework designed to properly abstract server-client communication in the *right* way and provide other useful utility for better game development workflow.

Note that Comet is currently in beta, but is soon about to be elevated. 

## Why use Comet over other frameworks?

Comet is a **direct** response to other frameworks which has it's own benefits:
      
- Easily expose direct primitive values to the clien (table, string, number, Instance, boolean) from the server without any headaches.

- Doesn't force you into keeping a specific code structure, unlike most other frameworks. Gives you freedom to keep your code structure the way you want.
 
- Much better server-client communication system.

- Provides many other useful utilities for better game development workflow.

- With a completely modular setup, the framework self won't have any issues with keeping in touch with newer updates.
